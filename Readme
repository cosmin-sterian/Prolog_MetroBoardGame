Metro Board game for one player.

The current game state is represented by PlacedTilesList:OpenPaths:ClosedPaths, where:
	- PlacedTilesList is a list with (Coordinates, TileID, RotationID) as elements, representing all the cards that have been placed until now
	- OpenPaths is a list with all the paths that remain open. A path is represented by EntryPointCoordinates:TilesList, where TilesList is a list with all the tiles composing the path
	- ClosedPaths is identical to OpenPaths, but the paths are complete(they reach an exit point).
